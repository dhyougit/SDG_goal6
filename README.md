# SDG_goal6
Sustainable development goal 6: A review of the linear and alternative projection methods used for monitoring progress on drinking water and sanitation using JMP database


##Summary
### Objective and method 
The WASH monitoring indicator can be a tool to predict the time trend of MDG and SDG goal achievement. Therefore, a proper statistical modeling should be selected after vigorous method review.
To achieved the objective, this report focus on following tasks: 
1) share descriptive statistics including N, SD, mean, skewness,
2) identify optimal parameter of prediction model including linear regression model and alternative spline approach,
3) examine validity of modelsâ€™ goodness-of-fit by checking RMSE measure, cross-validation outcome, subset RMSE test,
4) identify most optimized extrapolation method by testing four extrapolation options,
5) share WSH status progress prediction result over WHO region and World Bank region and each country.

Using the above objectives as criteria, two most optimal models were selecred and shows RMSE values per barch size.

Finally, the selected model is used to forcast the 4 years of progress of the SDG6 goals in the member states.
